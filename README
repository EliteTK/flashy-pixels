        This is an attempt at a relatively simple Software (CPU only) 3D
        graphics engine. It is a massive work in progress and definitely
        nothing professional.

This was all started in Eclipse and then moved to NetBeans since eclipse didn't
like the idea of visible text (compatibility problem - possibly some workaround
could be found but i always seemed to prefer the apparent "lightweightness" of
NetBeans anyway.)

At the present moment the project is well underway. I am currently working on
getting a display of some basic polygon graphics on the screen. The last major
breakthrough in my learning journey was something I was never taught: solving
simultaneous equations using matrices. This is essential to be able to get
proper interpolation between arbitrary points on a 2d plane done.

Another important thing I am currently learning about is threads. I am slowly
grasping the concepts of threads in java and have finally managed to get results
that work.

This is also the first project that i have ever carried on working on for so
long. I think i can greatly thank linux for providing me with a productive
environment as well as a great learning experience.

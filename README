No thank you, i don't need help.

Also... this is all currently being written on linux... so don't expect any text
files to have a .txt suffix.

This was also all written in first in Eclipse and then in NetBeans since eclipse
didn't like the idea of visible text (mainly because i was doing this all on
linux.)
